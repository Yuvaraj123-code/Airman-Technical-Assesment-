# PLAN

## Time blocks
1. Foundation (2h): schema, env/config, middleware, route wiring
2. Business logic (3h): auth/RBAC, courses, quiz scoring, bookings/conflict logic
3. Frontend core (2h): auth context, route guards, role-aware nav, key pages
4. DevOps + quality (1.5h): Docker Compose, CI, tests
5. Docs + demo prep (1h): README and assessment artifacts

## Prioritization
1. Acceptance-critical backend behavior first
2. Testable API contracts second
3. Frontend UI for required flows third
4. Automation and docs last
